"""RunPod serverless entry point for the MinerU worker.

The MinerU-specific pieces this orchestrates live in the worker/ package:
  worker.harness   — what this worker declares about itself to the harness
  worker.schema    — input validation
  worker.parse     — MinerU lazy import + async parse call
  worker.telemetry — optional OpenTelemetry export
  worker.warmup    — one throwaway parse at boot

The engine-agnostic ones come from the runpod_doc_worker package, which
worker.harness configures for this worker:
  transport.io      — fetch raw bytes from URL / b64 / volume + format detection
  transport.net     — target checks for the URL job inputs (used by io/schema)
  transport.package — tarball / inline / s3 response packaging
  obs.logging       — JSON / text structured logging
  obs.redact        — one shape for the text a failure reports
  obs.debug         — GPU info, model dir, /runpod-volume probe

The module surface (``handler.MAX_INLINE_FILE_MB``, ``handler._detect_format``,
``handler._validate_input``, ``handler._package_tarball``, etc.) is preserved
for tests/back-compat — see the re-exports near the bottom of this file.

    """Production worker bootstrap.

    Replicates ``runpod.serverless.worker.run_worker()`` but folds the
    eager warmup into the same asyncio loop that JobScaler.run() will
    use. The standard ``runpod.serverless.start()`` call chain creates
    a fresh event loop *inside* JobScaler.start() — if our warmup runs
    before that and creates its own loop via ``asyncio.run()``, vLLM's
    AsyncLLMEngine handle is bound to the warmup loop. When the
    JobScaler's loop starts and the first request tries to use the
    engine, the parent's view of the engine subprocess is dead
    (EngineDeadError ~75ms in). Composing both phases under one
    ``asyncio.run()`` keeps the engine handle alive across the
    warmup → serve transition.

    NOTE: This reaches into ``runpod.serverless.modules.rp_scale`` and
    ``rp_ping`` — undocumented internals of the runpod-python SDK.
    pyproject pins ``runpod>=1.7`` (worker SDK version 1.9.x at time
    of writing). A test in tests/test_runpod_internals.py asserts the
    internals we depend on still exist and have the expected shape; if
    the SDK refactors, that test fails fast instead of breaking
    production silently.
